Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms both try to find a minimum spanning tree in an undirected and weighted graph

Kruskal's time complexity is O(

Prim's algorithm is significantly faster in the limit when you've got a really dense graph with many more edges than vertices
Kruskal performs better in typical situations (sparse graphs)
