Array
1) SortedIterator O(1) space, Fail Safe, any modifications done after construction of the iterator won't be reflected.



Graph
1) Dijkstra's Algorithm:implemented using Priority Queue with comprehensive object priented implementation of Graph.
It calculates shortest paths for each Vertex in the graph and construct the path as well 
Time Complexity for one vertex is O(ElogV)


2) Detect Smallest Cycle In Graph: Check cycle from each vertex in the graph and returns the smallest one.


3) Prim's Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree

4) Kruskal's Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree


Tree
1) Check for Sub tree
2) Construct binary tree from ordered traveresed array
3) Find predecessor of a given node in a binary tree
4) Find Successor of a given node in a binary tree


String
1) Longest common prefix using Manber and Mayer Algorithm


Dynamic Programming
1) Find maximum Teams for the given players from different country


Linked List
1) IsPalindromicLinkedList
